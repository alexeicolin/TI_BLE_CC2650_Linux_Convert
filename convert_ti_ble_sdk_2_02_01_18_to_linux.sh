# Pass this script the path to the ti directory.  It tries to modify the ble stack sources
# to run under Linux.

# By default it assumes that the ble_sdk and tirtos directories have already been copied
# from a wine installation of the ble stack.

# If erase_it_all_and_copy_from_wine is passed as a second argument, then the script will
# erase the current BLE stack and TI RTOS directories, REMOVING AND CHANGES YOU HAVE MADE,
# and get fresh copies from the default wine installation path.  Be careful with this.
